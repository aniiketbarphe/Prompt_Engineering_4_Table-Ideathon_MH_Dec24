# Prompt_Engineering_4_Table-Ideathon_MH_Dec24

This Ideathon invites participants to explore innovative applications of prompt engineering to solve challenges in working with tabular data. With the rapid advancements in generative AI, crafting effective prompts has become a cornerstone for achieving high-quality results in tasks involving tabular datasets. Participants will design and demonstrate approaches that utilize prompt engineering to address key challenges in tabular data processing, analysis, and interpretation.

The goal is to develop solutions that leverage the potential of large language models (LLMs) to transform how we interact with, analyze, and derive insights from tabular data.
#
**2) Key Features Participants Could Focus On:**

**a) Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**

Using prompts to automate tasks like missing value imputation, outlier detection, and data normalization. Participants can showcase techniques to enhance data quality efficiently.

**b) Feature Engineering:**

Creating innovative prompt-based methods to identify meaningful features, generate new ones, or transform existing features, optimizing tabular datasets for downstream tasks.

**c) Insights and Summary Generation:**

Crafting prompts to generate insightful summaries or narratives about datasets, highlighting key trends, patterns, and anomalies in an intuitive, human-readable format.

**d) Natural Language Queries for Data Analysis:**

Developing systems that use prompts to translate natural language queries into actionable analyses or SQL queries, enabling non-technical users to interact seamlessly with tabular data.

**e) Multi-Table Joins and Schema Understanding:**

Exploring how prompt engineering can help in integrating data from multiple tables, understanding relationships, and producing meaningful insights.

**f) Outlier and Anomaly Detection:**

Using prompt-engineered techniques to detect and explain anomalies within the data, potentially combining statistical methods with generative AI capabilities.

**g) Advanced Visualization Recommendations:**

Leveraging LLMs to suggest or auto-generate visualizations tailored to specific user queries or dataset features, enhancing interpretability.
